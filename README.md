# SecretPartyBot
A Discord bot who's purpose is to create private channels for named members of a server. It can be used for small group collaboration within a larger server.

Link to my original version of this bot (Python): https://github.com/lrose07/ChnnlBot

To use the bot, enter the following command in any channel:

`%secret-party [private-channel-name] [space-sparated list of users to have access to the channel]`
